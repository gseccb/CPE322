This was mainly stuff you need to know to do to do some basic programming mixed with adding in some computer information.
While I was doing it I had some trouble with nano but after I added in some temporary text it saved with no issues which allowed me to do the other things with it. 
However when I tried to do man uname, it had issues with man, saying man is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable progra or batch file.
