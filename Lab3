Being in the python class with Professor Ryan I already had python and anaconda which I used to do this lab downloaded.
I had some issues with the instalation of the packages, but figured out that that had to do with the commands so I ended up resolving that.
then I ran into an issue with the code itself, in variable = sys.argv[1] saying that was out of bounds. This was the case in sun, coordinates, and address.
If I change that 1 to zero, it hits me with unrecognized name in sun, Geocoder timeouts ReadTimeoutError, MaxRetryError, ConnectionError and GeocoderUnavailable in coordinates, and 2 ValueErrors in address
CPU runs fine and identifies my 8 cores and utitilization as well as logging i log and phy
Battery runs none, I assume this is because I'm on a desktop pc
Theres the same issue as line 3 in document stats, but after changing 1 to zero it works, but it says that blank exists 23 times, word 5, def 4, wordcount 4, I am now realizing that's why there was extra after on the slides
These are analysing themselves unless given an input
This has led to proper results,

coordinates still lets out a lot of errors, but it did recognize the library, just guessing something is up with the connection same with address
document stats now makes more sense
